                Wouldn't it be NIFTY if there was an app that could:
                let you set up and create a profile
                most importantly: lets users pick what kind of nerd-dom they would like to engage in:
                (students can create different categories based on interest)
                so, this app would be like bumble (a people/matchmaking app), but for games (video game/tabletop/rpg)?
                a safe and accessible way to group people together based on interest, location and availability to get together and play games that they enjoy!
